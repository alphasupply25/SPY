I want to trade stock options automatically. So, for example, $SPY calls and puts. (However,
if this script can be built, I would want to trade this same script/strategy on multiple
tickers.)
I think I need to have this built in Python, because I will want to connect this with Interactive
Brokers via their API for live trading. Please let me know if you know of a better way to make
this happen. But, I use Interactive Brokers.
The best way I know how to explain what I am looking for is by using examples. Each
example includes a screen shot of what I have attempted to describe.
*all of this is based on a 5 minute ETH chart in the eastern US time zone (market open from
8:30am-3:00pm)*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary:
If the price at 9:00am is above the 9 EMA, and the 20 EMA, and the VWAP, then wait until
the price equals the 9 EMA, and at this moment, enter a long position.
Exit with $1.00 gain.
Stop loss a candle body close that’s below the 9 EMA, and the 20 EMA, and the VWAP.
For short positions; the opposite of everything above.
This is 1 trade per day, maximum. So, if there is an open trades at 2:55pm, then close this
trade at 2:55pm.
No trade taken if the price at 9:00am is anywhere between the 3 lines (2 EMA’s and VWAP).
It either has to be above all 3, or below all 3.
